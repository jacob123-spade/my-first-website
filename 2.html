        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup<br> 
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It<br> 
        defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted 
        <br>by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages 
        <br>such as JavaScript.

        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target = "_blank" title = "Web_browser">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a web server or from 
        <br>local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
        <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
        <br>and originally included cues for its appearance.

        <strong>HTML elements</strong> are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
        <br>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        <br>embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create 
        <br>structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as 
        <br>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML 
        <br>elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags 
        <br>such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the 
        <br>page. Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide 
        <br>information about document text and may include sub-element tags. 
        <br>Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
